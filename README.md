# about the copyright
1. The copyright of all the original posts belong to their authors accordingly, but you can share my translations using any convenient ways you want.

2. If I received a complain that says I don't have the right to translate one post, in such case, either the post is translated or in translating, I will remove it from this repository ASAP.

# about the translation progress
1. Unless I have marked one post as `100%` or `done`, one translation can't be referred as the final version, since it may be modified from time to time.

# about the quality
1. I'll try to interpretate the original text as clear as I can, but errors and flaws can't be fully avoided.
2. `issues` are welcomed to help me improve my translation.
